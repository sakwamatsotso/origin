    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>My academic qualification</h2>
    <p>
    I have a bachelors degree in Information Technology from Jomo Kenyatta University of Advanced Technology, having attained a second class upper division grade
    </p>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
    I work for Safaricom PLC as a telecoms Engineer supporting BSS system domains. I have over 5 years experience in Radio configuration and support
    </p>
    <h2>My Function</h2>
    <p>
    My work entails preparing scripts and running them on live systems. The task is detailed, repetitive  and very sensitive given that is running on live network.
    </p>
    <h1>Why I chose to enroll for a course in RPA</h1>
    <p>
    Over time we I have prepared these scripts manualy and run them myself to ensure they are successful. I have occasionally encountered errors (what I would call “human errors”) due to the manual way of working. It is because of this that I decided to find a way of having these tasks automated, hence the decision to enroll for this classes in RPA. I look forward to learn and enjoy working with Robots.
