# My Portfolio
#### This is my Week1 classwork on HTML and CSS , 23rd November 2021
#### By **Martin Sakwa**
## Description
This webpage highlights in summary of what I have learned in RPA class, week 1. HTML and CSS were used for coding and styling the code. VS application was picked on because it is an open source code and more user friendly
## Setup/Installation Requirements
To install VS code, you download a free version from the internet and any computer running on windows latest version. HTML is simple to use, and will run in all most all browsers such a Chrome/edge/Mozilla etc. The webpage is current hosted on github, for learning purposes
## Known Bugs
There are no known bugs at the moment. The page is though still under development.
## Technologies Used
I have used HTML and CSS since they very friendly to use and do not require licenses.
## Support and contact details
