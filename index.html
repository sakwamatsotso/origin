HTML and CSS were used for coding and styling the code. VS application was picked on because it is an open source code and more user friendly.</p>

  <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>My academic qualification</h2>
  <p>
    I have a bachelors degree in Information Technology from <em>Jomo Kenyatta University of Advanced Technology</em>,
    having attained a second class upper division grade
  </p>
  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I work for <strong> Safaricom PLC </strong> as a telecoms Engineer supporting <strong>BSS system domains</strong>. I
    have over <strong>5 years experience</strong> in Radio configuration and support
  </p>
  <h2>My Function</h2>
  <p>
    My work entails preparing scripts and running them on live systems. The task is detailed, repetitive and very
    sensitive given that is running on live network.
  </p>
  <h2>Why I chose to enroll for a course in RPA</h2>
  <p>
    Over time we I have prepared these scripts manualy and run them myself to ensure they are successful. I have
    occasionally encountered errors <em>(what I would call “human errors”)</em> due to the manual way of working. It is because of this that I decided to find a way of having these tasks automated, hence the decision to enroll for this
    classes in RPA. I look forward to learn and enjoy working with Robots.
